# Bioinformatics Survey

## About

This project aims to understand the field of bioinformatics by surveying the
people whom work in it. The survey was [first collected in 2008][2008] and has
since been used in discussions about bioinformatics careers (See [1][], [2][],
[3][], [4][]).

A new iteration of the survey was started by [Pierre Lindenbaum on
biostar][biostar]. The concrete outcomes for this survey are outlined in
[aims.txt][aims]. The questions that will be asked are listed in
[questions.yml][questions].

## Contributing

The are several ways you can get involved in this project. You can send
thoughts or suggestions to the [bioinfsurvey mailing list][list]. You can also
fork and make changes to this project via github. Finally this survey will only
be as successful as the number of survey respondents we receive. So once we
begin collecting data you can help by sharing the survey on twitter or your
blog. The twitter tag is [#bioinfsurvey][tag] for discussions.

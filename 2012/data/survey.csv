The projects that I have been involved with, some of them very large and with $millions of funding at stake, are really just software products, with features to deliver and users' needs to be met. Yet the folks running these projects, although highly intelligent, have no experience with software engineering and have little clue what it takes to ship a product. Thus the quality of their software is poor, and their developers end up frustrated, burnt out, or sitting around doing nothing.
